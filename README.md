# JoinTime
 Plugin to check when a player first joined the server
 
 Command: /jointime (username)
 
 It also saves data to a database since the firstJoinTime value gets randomly reset for some players for unknown reasons.
 
 I made another tool that adds all the users on your playerdata file and moves them into the database created by JoinTime: https://github.com/Kyrobi/JoinTimeIterator
